# InternTrackr User Guide

InternTrackr is a CLI-first internship application manager for university students applying to many internships. It helps you track where you applied, current status, and important dates in one place so you do not miss deadlines or lose track across spreadsheets, notes, and emails.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have **Java 17** or above installed.
2. Download the latest `interntrackr.jar`.
3. Copy the jar file into the folder you want to use as the home folder for Interntrackr.
4. Open a terminal, `cd` into that folder, and run:

   ```
   java -jar internTrackr.jar
   ```

   *(Optional: If you need to troubleshoot and view debug logs, append the logging flag: `java -jar internTrackr.jar --enable-logging`)*

5. Type commands and press Enter to execute.

Some commands you can try:

- `help` : Shows help.
- `add c/"Shopee" r/"Backend Intern"` : Adds a new application.
- `list` : Lists all applications.
- `list archive` : Lists all archived applications.
- `status 1 s/"Interview"` : Updates status of application 1.
- `archive 1` : Archives application 1.
- `exit` : Exits the app.

Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details.

## Features

> **Notes about the command format:**
>
> - Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by you.
    >   - Example: in `add c/COMPANY`, `COMPANY` can be `add c/"Shopee"` ...
> - Items in square brackets are optional.
    >   - Example: `deadline add ID t/TYPE d/DATE [n/NOTES]`
> - Parameters can be in any order unless stated otherwise.
> - For fields containing spaces, wrap them in quotes `"..."`.
> - Dates use the format `DD-MM-YYYY`.
> - **CRITICAL:** Do not use the pipe character (`|`) anywhere in your inputs. It is strictly prohibited and will cause an error.
> - Extra parameters for commands that do not take parameters (such as `help`, `overview`, `exit`) will be ignored.

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the full online User Guide.

**Format:** `help`

### Adding an application : `add`

Adds an internship application.

**Format:** `add c/COMPANY r/ROLE`

- Creates a new application with the given company and role.
- Prefixes can be provided in any order.
- Duplicate applications are not allowed.

**Examples:**

### Listing all applications : `list`

Shows a list of all tracked internship applications.
If an application has a note, it will be displayed indented on the line
directly below that application's details.

**Format:** `list`

**Example output:**
```
Here are your internship applications:
1. Company: Shopee | Role: Backend Intern | Status: Applied | ...
   Note: Strong Java skills required, prepare LeetCode
2. Company: Grab | Role: Data Analyst | Status: Interview | ...
```

### Deleting an application : `delete`

Deletes the specified active application.

**Format:** `delete INDEX`

- Deletes the application at the given `INDEX`.
- The index refers to the index number shown in the default application list.
- `INDEX` must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, ...
- Archived applications are not shown in the default list, so `delete` applies to the active applications currently displayed.

**Examples:**

- `delete 2`

### Updating application status : `status`

Updates the status of an existing application.

**Format:** `status INDEX s/STATUS`

- Updates the application at `INDEX`.
- `STATUS` should be one of the statuses supported (Applied, Pending, Interview, Offered, Rejected).

**Examples:**

- `status 1 s/"Pending"`
- `status 3 s/"Interview"`

### Logging an offer : `offer`

Updates an application with an offered salary and automatically changes its status to "Offered".

**Format:** `offer INDEX s/SALARY`

- Updates the application at the given `INDEX`.
- Logs the `SALARY` for compensation tracking (must not contain more than 2 decimal places).

**Examples:**

- `offer 1 s/5000.00`
- `offer 2 s/4500`

### Archiving an application : `archive`

Archives an internship application so it no longer appears in the default active application list.

**Format:** `archive INDEX`

- Archives the application at the given `INDEX`.
- The index refers to the index number shown in the default application list.
- `INDEX` must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, ...
- Archived applications are not deleted. They are hidden from the default `list` view and can still be viewed using `list archive`.

**Examples:**

- `archive 1`
- `archive 3`

### Listing archived applications : `list archive`

Shows all archived internship applications.

**Format:** `list archive`

- Displays only archived applications.
- Archived applications are shown using a separate index starting from 1 in the archived view.
- If an archived application has a note, the note will be displayed below it.

**Example output:**
```
Here are your archived internship applications:
1. Company: Shopee | Role: Backend Intern | Status: Rejected | ...
   Note: Rejected after OA
2. Company: Grab | Role: Data Analyst Intern | Status: Offered | ...
```

### Adding a note : `note`

Adds or updates a note for a specific internship application.
Notes are useful for recording interview impressions, tech stack requirements,
or any other application-specific insights.

**Format:** `note INDEX n/NOTE_CONTENT`

- Adds or **overwrites** the existing note for the application at `INDEX`.
- `INDEX` must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, ...
- `NOTE_CONTENT` can contain any text including spaces and special characters.

**Examples:**

- `note 1 n/Strong Java skills required, prepare LeetCode`
- `note 2 n/Remote friendly, good culture fit`

> **Note:** Running `note` on an application that already has a note will
> **overwrite** the previous note entirely.

### Filtering by status : `filter`

Shows only applications that match a given status.

### Clearing all data : `clear`

## Saving the Data
